# DSA Interview Preparation

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems specifically designed to help you prepare for technical interviews. The problems are categorized into various topics, and they include solutions and explanations to help you understand the concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a well-structured and comprehensive set of DSA problems that are commonly asked in interviews. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews at top tech companies or looking to improve your coding skills, this repository will guide you through different problem types with solutions and explanations.

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized by topics to make it easier for you to focus on specific areas. The categories include:

- **Arrays**: Basic array manipulation, searching, sorting, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations like reversal, merging, and finding intersections.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations and applications, such as balancing parentheses and implementing a queue using stacks.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Binary trees, binary search trees, graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path problems.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Common algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems like Fibonacci sequence, knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.
- **Recursion**: Backtracking, solving problems with recursive techniques.
